# A Tic-Tac-Toe game made in Python

To play this game, simply download the files and open up Windows Powershell, Command Prompt or Bash (anything will work)
You will then need to switch to the directory of the `tic-tac-toe` folder. To do so, you can use the following command.
```
cd <directory_path>
```

Here are a couple useful commands to keep in mind while playing the game.
```
.play_pvp
.play_pvc
.quit
```
These commands will, respective, match you against a human player, a computer, and the `.quit` command terminates the program. You can use the `.quit` command to exit the game at any point you want.
